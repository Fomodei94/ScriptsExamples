# Scripts Examples

Examples of shell scripts for personal use.

These scripts use RegEx and simple core unix utilities.

## Cinema

Shell script to fetch information on cinema's movies from the web, such as timetables, plot, length etc.

## PacktPub *

This script fetches current Packt Publishing free ebook of the day.

* **Update 2020/04/14**: due to massive change of packtpub website (which has become much more dynamical), the old shell script is now **deprecated**. Gathering free ebooks infos just from static html page is not possible anymore. I chose to rewrite the script using _Python_ and _Selenium_ library, making it more simple(as for effort), more human-readable, with much more potential(due to Selenium library), but also much slower in computation.

## Zoo

This script fetches links to every episode of zoo105 podcast of the past 7 days.
(and automatize download if you have jdownloader2 installed).
